## Keith Pacholczak
         Keith is an artist and student at Confederation College. He is currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Development program, in which he created the short, "Vanora", for his 2D Animation course. Keith has enjoyed drawing his entire life so stepping into the world of 2D animation was a welcome challenge for him. Keith has also long been a fan of genre content and animation, which inspired him greatly when coming up with the character and story.
