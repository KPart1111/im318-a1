<h2>Character Turnaround</h2>
<p>Vanora's character design was inspired by betta fish. The deep blues and burgundies can be found on these colourful, aquatic creatures. The sharper angles of her design such as her jacket collar, the ends of her sleeves, and the tips of her hair strands were meant to resemble the similar shapes created by betta fish's fins. Her long, flowing jacket was meant to flow in a similar way to the large tails of betta fish, especially when underwater.</p>

<h2>Accessories</h2>
<p>Vanora's accessories are her weapons. She carries twin hydro-blades. The blades themselves are made of water, giving Vanora a greater connection to them and more control when in combat. When the blades are not activated the weapons can be used as expandable batons, which are perfect for if Vanora does not want to cut someone or something. The blades can also attach together at their ends to create a staff-like weapon.</p>

<h2>Background Painting</h2>
<p>The acient doorway that Vanora finds was designed with ocean in mind. The top of the door is meant to resemble sea-shell, while the pillars on either side were chosen for their resemblence to Greek architecture as reference to the lost city of Atlantis, which famously was said to have sank into the ocean. Finally, etched into the stone of the door are Vanora's hyrdo-blades, giving her a direct connection to it. They are shown to be blasting water, which gives Vanora a clue.</p>
